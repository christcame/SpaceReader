export const NEW_STORY_PROMPT = "Write a dark and funny about a circus clown who meets and falls in love with a mime.  Their love is forbidden.  Their families don't understand.  Give the story a clear beginning, middle, and end. The story is for adults. Provide the response as a JSON object with a 'title' (string) and a 'story' (string) field. The story should be 1000 words in a single block of plain text without any markdown formatting.  Make the story completely unique and different from the last story you told.  Give it a raw, explosive ending that tugs at the reader's heartstrings.  The story progresses rapidly, as do their feelings for each other.  Give the reader a clear picture of what they look like physically, give them deep personalities, and add more dirty talk";
